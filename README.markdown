Sequence Mediaworks StaticMatic Base
====================================

About
-----

I've been using StaticMatic for a while and I keep having to do the same setup over and over again.  I need jQuery, 960.gs, and some default templates.  In DRY fashion, why not just make a Git repo out of it?

What This Includes
------------------
* Default layout with:
    * An overridable title
    * A relative link to the base.css stylesheet
    * Header, footer, JavaScripts list
* A header with:
    * Space for a logo
    * Right-justified nav
* A footer with:
    * Copyright boilerplate
    * The current year
* Default index page with:
    * Sidebar-style layout
    * A JavaScript reference to index.js
    * A page title override
* jQuery libs:
    * jQuery 1.4.4
    * jQuery UI 1.8.8
* Sass SCSS-style files:
    * A converted reset.css and 12-column 960.gs CSS now included into the base stylesheet
    * Separate SCSS-style files for global colors, fonts, header style, etc.
